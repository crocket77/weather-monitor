First download the zip file and extract the files or clone from Github to a folder and open the index.html in your browser for the API to work correctly.
Enter a city and you will get the current and future weather conditions along with temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index. 
It will also save the cities you have searched locally and populate that into the drop down so you can easily look at previously searched cities.
